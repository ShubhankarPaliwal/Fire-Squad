# Line of Automata

This project implements a **Line of Automata** simulation using Python. The program models a sequence of automata where each cell changes its state based on predefined rules and the states of neighboring cells.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to understand and demonstrate concepts of **automata theory**, **state transitions**, and **rule-based systems** through a practical Python implementation.

## Features
- Simulation of a one-dimensional line of automata
- Rule-based state transition logic
- Clear and structured Python code
- Easy to modify rules and initial states

## Technologies Used
- Python

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Run the main Python file:
```bash
python main.py
